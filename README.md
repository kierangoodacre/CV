###Personal Statement

A lover of all things that push the boundaries, this what attracted me to software development. My pre-Makers background in offshore renewables as a ROV pilot technician/Engineer and the work I carried out at a now VC funded start up, I hope proves the perfect backdrop for a successful career in tech. Currently seeking a role as a developer at a firm with a strong personal development culture and dedication to code & design craftsmanship. Future employers will be impressed with my ability to fit into a team, whilst still maintaining the ability to work as an individual and look to add value wherever possible.
